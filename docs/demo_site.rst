Demo Site
=========

There is a demo site available at https://apostello-demo.herokuapp.com

You can login with the email ``test@example.com`` and the password ``apostello``.

Note that:

* All the data is reset every hour
* You cannot send or receive messages as there are no Twilio credentials
* No emails can be sent either (so signing up as new user will not work)
* The demo site is running on the free tier of Heroku, so it may be unavailable as it needs to sleep 6 hours everyday
