Keywords
--------

All incoming messages are expected to start with a keyword. This allows for custom replies to be sent back and is useful for tracking things like event sign ups or questions for a Q&A.

Special Keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a small set of reserved keywords, some by Twilio and some by apostello.

* Twilio's reserved keywords can be found `here <https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/sms/does-twilio-support-stop-block-and-cancel-aka-sms-filtering>`_.
* apostello also reserves the keyword **name**. Any SMS that matches **name** will be parsed for a name and used to update the name associated with that contact. If the parsing fails, then the contact is sent another message asking them to try again.

Custom Keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create as many keywords as you like, and each keyword comes with the following features:

* Custom response
* Number of response tracked
* Ability to mark each response as "Requires Action" or "Dealt With"
* Archiving of old responses
* Activation time and a too early custom response
* Deactivation time and a too late custom response
* Ability to lock a keyword to certain users (staff users can always see all keywords)
* Daily email digests - send digest of today's responses every night
* CSV export of messages

Keyword Matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A case insensitive greedy match is performed on the start of every incoming
message up to the first space in the message. For example, the messages
`connect John Calvin` and `connected John Calvin` would both match the keyword
`connect`, but only the second message would match the keyword `connected`.

There is an additional check when creating new keywords - you cannot create a
keyword that cause a match collision. For example, if `connect` is a keyword,
you will be unable to create `con`, `conn` or `connected`, etc.
