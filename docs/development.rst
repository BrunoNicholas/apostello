A docker compose config is provided for easy local development.

Instructions:

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. (You do not need the DB, RabbitMQ or opbeat values)
3. Run docker-compose up
4. In a separate terminal run `docker-compose run web ./manage.py migrate`
4. Visit 127.0.0.1:4000
5. You can run django management commands by running `docker-compose run web ./manage.py createsuperuser`

The frontend assets can be found in `apostello/assets`, here you can see the different gulp tasks, etc.
