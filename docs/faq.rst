Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What is the character limit for an SMS?
---------------------------------------

By default, each SMS is limited to 160 characters.
Twilio can send messages up to 1600 characters long, but it will charge you multiple times, e.g. a 1600 character message will be charged the same as 10 messages.

The character limit can be increased on the Site Configuration page (``Tools --> Site Configuration``).

How do I "mail merge" my messages?
----------------------------------

Any occurrence of ``name%`` in outgoing messages or keyword replies will be replaced by the first name of the contact.
For example, ``Hi %name%!`` becomes ``Hi John!``


How do I cancel scheduled messages?
-----------------------------------

Go to ``Menu --> Scheduled Messages``, and click the cancel button for any scheduled messages you wish to cancel.

How do I setup the slack integration?
-------------------------------------

Create a new Slack incoming `webhook <https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/>`_.
Then open the Site Configuration page (``Tools --> Site Configuration``) and paste the hook URL you were given by Slack.
Click save and all your incoming messages should show up in the Slack channel you picked when creating the webhook.
