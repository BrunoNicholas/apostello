*free SMS communication software for your church*

Introduction
============

apostello is a web app designed to allow a church to communicate with its congreegation via SMS. Messages can be sent, received and automatically replied to.

apostello was written for use at St Columba's Free Church as we couldn't find a cheap SMS solution that fit all our needs and has been running in production since early 2015.
